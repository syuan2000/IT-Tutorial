Nowadays, AI is used in almost all industries, giving a technological edge to all companies
integrating AI at scale. According to McKinsey, AI has the potential to create 600 billions
of dollars of value in retail, bring 50 percent more incremental value in banking compared
with other analytics techniques. In transport and logistic, the potential revenue jump is
89 percent more.

Concretely, if an organization uses AI for its marketing team, it can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, allowing the sales representative to focus on tasks like relationship building, lead nurturing, etc. A company name Gong provides a conversation intelligence service. Each time a Sales Representative make a phone call, the machine records transcribes and analyzes the chat. The VP can use AI analytics and recommendation to formulate a winning strategy.

In a nutshell, AI provides a cutting-edge technology to deal with complex data which is impossible to handle by a human being. AI automates redundant jobs allowing a worker to focus on the high level, value-added tasks. When AI is implemented at scale, it leads to cost reduction and revenue increase.
