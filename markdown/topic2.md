## A brief History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence is a buzzword today, although this term is not new. In 1956, a group of avant-garde experts from different backgrounds decided to organize a summer research project on AI. Four bright minds led the project; John McCarthy (Dartmouth College), Marvin Minsky (Harvard University), Nathaniel Rochester (IBM), and Claude Shannon (Bell Telephone Laboratories).

The primary purpose of the research project was to tackle "every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence that can in principle be so precisely described, that a machine can be made to simulate it."

The proposal of the summits included

+ Automatic Computers
+ How Can a Computer Be Programmed to Use a Language?
+ Neuron Nets
+ Self-improvement

It led to the idea that intelligent computers can be created. A new era began, full of hope - **Artificial intelligence.**
