## Type of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence can be divided into three subfields:

1. Artificial intelligence
2. Machine learning
3. Deep learning


**Machine Learning**<br>
Machine learning is the art of study of algorithms that learn from examples and experiences.

Machine learning is based on the idea that there exist some patterns in the data that were identified and used for future predictions.

The difference from hardcoding rules is that the machine learns on its own to find such rules.

**Deep learning**<br>
Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning. Deep learning does not mean the machine learns more in-depth knowledge; it means the machine uses different layers to learn from the data. The depth of the model is represented by the number of layers in the model. For instance, Google LeNet model for image recognition counts 22 layers.

In deep learning, the learning phase is done through a neural network. A neural network is an architecture where the layers are stacked on top of each other.

**AI vs. Machine Learning**<br>
Most of our smartphone, daily device or even the internet uses Artificial intelligence. Very often, AI and machine learning are used interchangeably by big companies that want to announce their latest innovation. However, Machine learning and AI are different in some ways.

AI- artificial intelligence- is the science of training machines to perform human tasks. The term was invented in the 1950s when scientists began exploring how computers could solve problems on their own.

Artificial Intelligence is a computer that is given human-like properties. Take our brain; it works effortlessly and seamlessly to calculate the world around us. Artificial Intelligence is the concept that a computer can do the same. It can be said that AI is the large science that mimics human aptitudes.

Machine learning is a distinct subset of AI that trains a machine how to learn. Machine learning models look for patterns in data and try to conclude. In a nutshell, the machine does not need to be explicitly programmed by people. The programmers give some examples, and the computer is going to learn what to do from those samples.
